Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.340 ns between Inst_system_clocks/rst_ipb_reg/C (clocked by clk_ipb_i) and flash_reader/flash_master/bufin_reg[2]/CE (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#189 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.341 ns between Inst_system_clocks/rst_ipb_reg/C (clocked by clk_ipb_i) and flash_reader/flash_master/bufin_reg[7]/CE (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
